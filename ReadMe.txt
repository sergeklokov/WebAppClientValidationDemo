This is JavaScript (JQuery really) demo of Blacklist and Whitelist validation.
I used only one word. Later, I will try to connect file of words from OWASP Top 10 for validation.

Note: balcklist.html use JavaScript Closure. 

So go straight to 
wwwroot\blacklist.html

then to 
wwwroot\whitelist.html
